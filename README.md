# AXA-Mental-Health-Assessment

## Project Overview
The above project was developed as part of AXA_Health take-home task for a Data scientist Position. The task aims to predict mental Illness of Individuals using Machine Learning Techniques

## Key Objectives
<b>Data Analysis & Insights</b>: Perform expoloratory data analysis to discover trends and anomalies

<b> Model Development and Evaluation</b>: Experiment with different machine learning techniques and select the
best performing model based on key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score

<b> Final Model</b>: Make a final model with the best- performing hyperparameters and assess its performances

## Final Model
- The Final Model was chosen to be **Logistic Regression** with hyperparameters tuned via grid search
- The final model achieved:

   Accuracy: 61.7%
  --Precision: 39.19%
  --Recall: 45.86%
  --F1 Score:42.26%
